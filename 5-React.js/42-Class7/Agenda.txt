Topics that we will cover today are:
1. useEffect Hook
    i.  useEffect without dependencies() runs on every render + first render
    ii. useEffect with empty dependency ([]) only runs for first time.
    iii.useEffect with multiple dependencies ([users]) only runs for first time and when users changes


2. Lists
    We generally use array's map method for it.
        - we must key to returning html element to uniquely identify that.
